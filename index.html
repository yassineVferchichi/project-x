        <p id="p3">Socrates, the ancient Greek philosopher, was notorious for being a bit of a pest in Athens. He wandered the streets asking questions that made people scratch their heads. Some called him wise; others called him a pain in the togas.

            His style was simple: ask questions until people realized they didn't know as much as they thought. Imagine a guy at a party constantly asking, "But why?" â€” that was Socrates.
            
            Eventually, his relentless questioning got him into trouble. They accused him of corrupting the youth and being disrespectful to the gods. At his trial, instead of begging for mercy, he proposed that he should be rewarded with free meals for life. Classic Socrates!
            
            But the jury wasn't having it. They made him drink poison. Even then, he went out like a boss, philosophizing until the very end.
            
            And that's the story of Socrates, the guy who gave us wisdom, wit, and a lesson in how to annoy people with questions.
